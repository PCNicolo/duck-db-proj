# SQL Query Execution DataFrame Comparison Fix

## Issue Summary
The SQL Analytics Studio was throwing an error when executing certain SQL queries, particularly those with COUNT(DISTINCT) operations:
```
Query error: The truth value of a DataFrame is ambiguous. Use a.empty, a.bool(), a.item(), a.any() or a.all().
```

## Root Cause
The bug was in `app.py:212` where the code was incorrectly checking if a DataFrame result was truthy:
```python
# Problematic code
if result and len(result) > 0:  # This causes ambiguity error with DataFrames
```

The `QueryEngine.execute_query()` method already returns a pandas DataFrame, but the code was treating it as a different type and using an ambiguous boolean check.

## Solution
Fixed the DataFrame handling in the `execute_query` function in `app.py`:
```python
# Fixed code
if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame) and not result.empty:
    return result
elif isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
    return result  # Return empty DataFrame as-is
```

## Test Coverage
Created comprehensive E2E tests in `tests/test_sql_execution_dataframe.py` that:
1. Reproduce the original DataFrame ambiguity error
2. Test correct DataFrame handling patterns
3. Test COUNT(DISTINCT) queries that triggered the issue
4. Verify the fixed execute_query function
5. Integration test simulating the actual app behavior

## Files Modified
- `app.py`: Fixed execute_query function to properly handle DataFrame results
- `tests/test_sql_execution_dataframe.py`: New comprehensive test suite

## Verification
All tests pass successfully, confirming the issue is resolved and the SQL query execution now properly handles DataFrame results without ambiguity errors.

Sample Dataset Ideas:

Sales Analysis: Download sample sales data and analyze:

Monthly revenue trends
Top products by category
Customer segmentation
Join customer and order tables


Log File Analysis: Process web server logs:

Parse timestamps
Aggregate by endpoint
Find error patterns
Window functions for rolling averages



Advanced Extensions:

Add a simple Flask/FastAPI endpoint that accepts SQL queries
Create materialized views for frequently accessed aggregations
Benchmark DuckDB vs pandas on 1GB+ CSV files
Build a CLI tool for quick data exploration
Implement incremental data loading with timestamps

Why This Project Works:

Practical: Mimics real data engineering tasks
Scalable: Start with small CSVs, scale to GBs
Comprehensive: Covers I/O, SQL, Python integration
Reusable: You'll build utilities you can use in other projects

Start with just the CSV reading functionality, then gradually add features. DuckDB's killer feature is how it can query files directly without loading them into memory - perfect for data exploration and ETL pipelines!

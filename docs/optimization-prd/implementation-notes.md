# Implementation Notes

## Development Approach
- Implement stories sequentially to minimize risk
- Each story should be independently deployable
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Document all changes in changelog

## Dependencies
- No new major dependencies required
- Consider adding `sqlparse` for SQL formatting
- May need `streamlit-ace` for better code editing

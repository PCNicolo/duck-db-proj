# Risk Mitigation Strategy

## Primary Risks
1. **Breaking existing functionality during refactoring**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test coverage, feature flags for new functionality
   - Rollback: Git-based version control with tagged releases

2. **Performance degradation from new features**
   - Mitigation: Performance testing, profiling, and optimization
   - Rollback: Configuration flags to disable new features

3. **LM-Studio compatibility issues**
   - Mitigation: Version pinning, fallback to basic prompts
   - Rollback: Keep original prompt templates available

# Technical Considerations

## Performance Requirements
- SQL generation response time < 3 seconds
- Query execution for 100K rows < 2 seconds
- UI interactions respond within 200ms
- Schema caching reduces repeated extraction by 80%

## Security Considerations
- Sanitize all SQL inputs to prevent injection
- Validate file paths for security
- Implement query timeout limits
- Add rate limiting for LM-Studio requests

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each modified function
- Integration tests for story workflows
- Performance benchmarks before/after
- User acceptance testing for UI changes

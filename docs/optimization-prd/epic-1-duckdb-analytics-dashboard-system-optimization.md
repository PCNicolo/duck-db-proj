# Epic 1: DuckDB Analytics Dashboard System Optimization

**Epic Goal**: Enhance the overall system reliability, usability, and performance while maintaining all existing functionality and ensuring backward compatibility.

**Integration Requirements**: All changes must maintain compatibility with existing data files, preserve chat history functionality, and ensure no regression in current features.

## Story 1.1: Fix NoneType Error in Copy-to-Editor Functionality

**As a** data analyst,
**I want** the copy-to-editor button to work reliably,
**so that** I can easily transfer generated SQL queries to the editor for modification.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Investigate root cause of NoneType error in query result handling
2. Implement proper null checking and error handling
3. Ensure query results are properly stored in session state
4. Add fallback mechanism for missing dataframe references
5. Display user-friendly error messages when issues occur

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing SQL execution flow remains unchanged
- IV2: Session state management doesn't break other features
- IV3: Performance impact is negligible (<100ms added latency)

**Technical Notes:**
- Check `st.session_state` management for query results
- Verify dataframe initialization in query execution path
- Add defensive programming patterns throughout

## Story 1.2: Enhance LM-Studio Context and Prompt Engineering

**As a** user writing natural language queries,
**I want** the LLM to receive comprehensive schema context,
**so that** it generates more accurate SQL queries on first attempt.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Enhance schema extraction to include:
   - Column data types and constraints
   - Sample data values (configurable)
   - Table relationships and foreign keys
   - Row counts and statistics
2. Optimize prompt template in `SQL_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
3. Implement context window management (max tokens)
4. Add schema caching with smart invalidation
5. Include query validation against actual schema

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing SQL generation endpoint remains compatible
- IV2: Schema extraction doesn't impact query performance
- IV3: Cache invalidation works correctly on table changes

**Technical Implementation:**
- Enhance `SchemaExtractor.format_for_llm()` method
- Implement intelligent context truncation for large schemas
- Add configuration for context detail level

## Story 1.3: Optimize SQL Query Execution Pipeline

**As a** user executing SQL queries,
**I want** faster and more reliable query processing,
**so that** I get results quickly with clear feedback on issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement query result streaming for large datasets
2. Add progress indicators for long-running queries
3. Improve error handling with actionable messages
4. Optimize result caching strategy
5. Add query execution metrics and logging

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All existing query types continue to work
- IV2: Cache functionality remains backward compatible
- IV3: No regression in query execution times

## Story 1.4: SQL Editor UI Cleanup and Enhancement

**As a** SQL developer,
**I want** a clean and efficient SQL editor interface,
**so that** I can write and modify queries productively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Reorganize SQL editor layout for better space utilization
2. Add syntax highlighting for SQL code
3. Implement query history with quick access
4. Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
5. Create collapsible sections for schema viewer
6. Improve copy/paste functionality
7. Add query formatting/beautification option

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing query submission flow unchanged
- IV2: Chat history display remains functional
- IV3: All current editor features still accessible

## Story 1.5: Optimize Analytics Tab Functionality

**As a** data analyst,
**I want** the Analytics tab to provide meaningful insights quickly,
**so that** I can understand my data without writing SQL.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Add pre-built analytics templates for common analyses
2. Implement smart summary statistics based on data types
3. Add data profiling capabilities
4. Create interactive filter/aggregation builder
5. Optimize performance for large datasets

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing analytics functions continue working
- IV2: Tab switching doesn't lose state
- IV3: Query engine integration remains stable

## Story 1.6: Enhance Visualizations Tab

**As a** user analyzing data,
**I want** better visualization options and controls,
**so that** I can create meaningful charts from query results.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Add more chart types (heatmaps, treemaps, etc.)
2. Implement smart chart type recommendations
3. Add interactive chart configuration panel
4. Enable chart export in multiple formats
5. Implement dashboard-style multi-chart layouts

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing Plotly integrations remain functional
- IV2: Chart rendering performance maintained
- IV3: Data pipeline to charts unchanged

## Story 1.7: Improve Data Explorer Tab

**As a** user exploring datasets,
**I want** an intuitive data exploration interface,
**so that** I can quickly understand table contents and relationships.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Add advanced filtering UI with multiple conditions
2. Implement column-level search and filtering
3. Add data export with format options
4. Create table relationship visualizer
5. Implement pagination for large tables

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing table display functionality preserved
- IV2: DuckDB query generation remains compatible
- IV3: Performance acceptable for large datasets

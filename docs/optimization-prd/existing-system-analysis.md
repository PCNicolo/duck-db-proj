# Existing System Analysis

## Current Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **Database**: DuckDB (embedded analytical database)
- **AI Integration**: LM-Studio (local LLM for SQL generation)
- **APIs**: OpenAI client library for LM-Studio communication
- **File Processing**: CSV and Parquet file support
- **Dependencies**: pandas, httpx, plotly for visualizations

## Current System Capabilities
- Natural language to SQL conversion via LM-Studio
- Schema extraction and formatting for LLM context
- SQL query execution with result caching
- File upload and registration as DuckDB tables
- Multiple UI tabs for different analytics workflows
- Chat-based interaction history

## Known Issues and Pain Points
1. **NoneType Error**: Copy-to-editor functionality fails with "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'df'"
2. **Limited Schema Context**: LM-Studio receives insufficient schema information for accurate SQL generation
3. **UI Clutter**: SQL editor interface needs cleanup and better organization
4. **Tab Optimization**: Analytics, Visualizations, and Data Explorer tabs not fully optimized for use cases
5. **Error Handling**: Inadequate error messages and debugging information

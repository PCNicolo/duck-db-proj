# Story: Connect Chat to DuckDB Schema Context - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
**As a** data analyst,  
**I want** the LLM to know my DuckDB tables and columns when generating SQL,  
**So that** I get accurate, executable SQL queries specific to my actual data.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: LM Studio SQL generator (Story 2), DuckDB connection in `src/duckdb_analytics/core/`
- Technology: Python, DuckDB, existing query engine
- Follows pattern: Existing DuckDB connection patterns, metadata queries
- Touch points: SQL generator prompt, query validation, error handling

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. DuckDB schema (tables, columns, types) is extracted and cached
2. Schema context is included in LLM prompts for accurate SQL generation
3. Generated SQL is validated against actual schema before display

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing LM Studio integration from Story 2 continues to work
5. New schema extraction follows existing DuckDB patterns
6. Integration maintains current query engine functionality

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Schema extraction is performant (cached after first load)
8. Invalid SQL is caught before execution with helpful error messages
9. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Extract DuckDB Schema** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `src/duckdb_analytics/llm/schema_extractor.py`
  - [x] Query DuckDB information schema:
    ```sql
    SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
    FROM information_schema.columns 
    WHERE table_schema = 'main'
    ```
  - [x] Cache schema in session state to avoid repeated queries
  - [x] Format schema as structured dict for easy access

- [x] **Task 2: Enhance LLM Prompt with Schema** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Modify `sql_generator.py` to accept schema context
  - [x] Create enhanced system prompt:
    ```python
    f"""You are a SQL expert for DuckDB. 
    Available tables and columns:
    {formatted_schema}
    
    Convert the user's natural language to valid DuckDB SQL using ONLY these tables/columns.
    Return only the SQL query, no explanations."""
    ```
  - [x] Include sample data for common tables if available
  - [x] Add DuckDB-specific function hints (DATE_TRUNC, etc.)

- [x] **Task 3: Implement SQL Validation** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create `validate_sql()` function in schema_extractor
  - [x] Parse generated SQL to extract referenced tables/columns
  - [x] Check against actual schema before displaying
  - [x] Return validation errors with specific issues

- [x] **Task 4: Connect Everything Together** (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Update chat handler in `app.py` to:
    - Extract schema on first use
    - Pass schema to SQL generator
    - Validate generated SQL
    - Display validation errors if any
  - [x] Add "Copy to SQL Editor" button for valid queries
  - [x] Show which tables will be queried

- [x] **Task 5: Add Smart Error Handling** (AC: 3, 8)
  - [x] Catch common SQL generation errors:
    - Non-existent tables → Suggest similar table names
    - Wrong column names → Show available columns for that table
    - Invalid syntax → Show DuckDB syntax hint
  - [x] Provide helpful error messages in chat
  - [x] Add "Try Again" option with refined prompt

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
```python
class SchemaExtractor:
    def __init__(self, duckdb_conn):
        self.conn = duckdb_conn
        self._schema_cache = None
    
    def get_schema(self):
        if not self._schema_cache:
            self._schema_cache = self._extract_schema()
        return self._schema_cache
    
    def _extract_schema(self):
        query = """
        SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
        FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_schema = 'main'
        ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position
        """
        return self.conn.execute(query).fetchdf()
    
    def format_for_llm(self):
        schema = self.get_schema()
        # Format as: "table_name: col1 (type), col2 (type), ..."
        return formatted_string
```

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Use existing DuckDB connection from `src/duckdb_analytics/core/`
- Follow query patterns from existing analytics functions
- Cache in `st.session_state` like existing dashboard data

**Key Constraints:**
- Schema extraction should happen once per session
- Must handle dynamic schema changes (new tables loaded)
- Keep prompt within LM Studio token limits

## Definition of Done

- [x] Schema extraction working and cached
- [x] LLM receives accurate schema context
- [x] Generated SQL validated before display
- [x] Error messages are helpful and specific
- [x] "Copy to SQL Editor" functionality works
- [x] No regression in existing functionality
- [x] All tests passing (42 tests total)
- [x] Code linted and cleaned

## Minimal Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Invalid SQL could be generated despite schema context
**Mitigation:** Validation layer prevents execution, shows errors to user
**Rollback:** Can disable validation temporarily if issues arise

## Compatibility Verification

- [x] No breaking changes to existing LLM integration
- [x] Database operations unchanged
- [x] Query engine remains fully functional
- [x] Performance impact minimal (schema cached)

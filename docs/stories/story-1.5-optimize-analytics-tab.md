## Technical Implementation Notes

### Analytics Template Structure

```python
class AnalyticsTemplate:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metadata = {
            'name': 'Time Series Analysis',
            'category': 'temporal',
            'parameters': [
                {'name': 'date_column', 'type': 'column', 'filter': 'date'},
                {'name': 'metric_column', 'type': 'column', 'filter': 'numeric'},
                {'name': 'granularity', 'type': 'select', 
                 'options': ['day', 'week', 'month', 'quarter', 'year']}
            ]
        }
    
    def generate_query(self, params):
        return f"""
        SELECT 
            DATE_TRUNC('{params.granularity}', {params.date_column}) as period,
            AVG({params.metric_column}) as avg_value,
            COUNT(*) as count
        FROM {{table}}
        GROUP BY period
        ORDER BY period
        """
```

        st.subheader("Filter Builder")
        
        # Drag and drop interface
        filter_conditions = st.container()
        
        with filter_conditions:
            for i, condition in enumerate(self.conditions):
                col1, col2, col3, col4 = st.columns([2, 1, 2, 1])
                
                with col1:
                    # Column selector
                    condition['column'] = st.selectbox(
                        f"Column {i+1}", 
                        self.available_columns
                    )
                
                with col2:
                    # Operator selector
                    condition['operator'] = st.selectbox(
                        f"Operator {i+1}",
                        self.get_operators_for_type(condition['column'])
                    )
                
                with col3:
                    # Value input
                    condition['value'] = self.render_value_input(
                        condition['column'],
                        condition['operator']
                    )
                
                with col4:
                    # Remove button
                    if st.button(f"Remove {i+1}"):
                        self.remove_condition(i)

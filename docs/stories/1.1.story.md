# Story 1.1: Fix NoneType Error in Copy-to-Editor Functionality

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** data analyst,
**I want** the copy-to-editor button to work reliably,
**so that** I can easily transfer generated SQL queries to the editor for modification.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Investigate root cause of NoneType error in query result handling
2. Implement proper null checking and error handling
3. Ensure query results are properly stored in session state
4. Add fallback mechanism for missing dataframe references
5. Display user-friendly error messages when issues occur

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Investigate and identify root cause of NoneType error (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Analyze the copy-to-editor button implementation in app.py (lines 368-370)
  - [ ] Trace the query_result session state initialization and lifecycle
  - [ ] Identify scenarios where query_result might be None or uninitialized
  - [ ] Review the execute_query function for proper result storage (lines 695-709)

- [ ] Task 2: Implement proper null checking and defensive programming (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Add query_result initialization to session state setup (around line 85-100)
  - [ ] Add null checks before accessing st.session_state.query_result
  - [ ] Implement try-catch blocks around dataframe operations
  - [ ] Ensure clean_sql is properly validated before setting editor_sql
  - [ ] Add validation that SQL was successfully extracted from chat message

- [ ] Task 3: Improve error handling and user feedback (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add user-friendly error messages for missing query results
  - [ ] Implement fallback behavior when query_result is not available
  - [ ] Add toast/notification when copy operation succeeds
  - [ ] Handle edge cases like empty SQL or malformed queries

- [ ] Task 4: Verify session state management integrity (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Ensure query_result persists correctly across reruns
  - [ ] Verify editor_sql transfer mechanism works reliably
  - [ ] Check that st.rerun() doesn't cause state loss
  - [ ] Test with multiple concurrent sessions

- [ ] Task 5: Add comprehensive unit tests
  - [ ] Create test_copy_to_editor.py in tests/ directory
  - [ ] Test null/None scenarios for query_result
  - [ ] Test successful copy-to-editor flow
  - [ ] Test error conditions and fallback behavior
  - [ ] Test session state persistence

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No specific guidance found in architecture docs (this is the first story in the .story.md format)

### Current Implementation Analysis
Based on code inspection of app.py:

**Copy-to-Editor Implementation** [Source: app.py#L368-370]:
- Button triggers setting `st.session_state.editor_sql = clean_sql`
- Followed by `st.rerun()` to refresh the interface
- Editor checks for `editor_sql` in session state [Source: app.py#L396-398]

**Query Result Handling** [Source: app.py#L704]:
- `execute_query()` sets `st.session_state.query_result = df`
- No initialization of `query_result` in session state setup [Source: app.py#L85-100]
- `query_result` accessed without null checks [Source: app.py#L422, L518]

**Session State Initialization** [Source: app.py#L85-100]:
- Initializes: db_connection, query_engine, file_manager, sql_generator, schema_extractor
- Chat-related states: chat_history, processing_query, last_query_time, pending_query, schema_cache
- Missing: query_result, execution_time initialization

### Data Models
No specific schemas related to this bug fix - working with Streamlit session state dictionary

### API Specifications
No external API calls involved - internal Streamlit state management

### Component Specifications
**Streamlit Components Used**:
- `st.button()` for Copy to Editor trigger
- `st.session_state` for state management
- `st.text_area()` for SQL editor display
- `st.rerun()` for UI refresh after state change

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- Main application: `/app.py`
- Test files: `/tests/` directory
- Core query engine: `/src/duckdb_analytics/core/query_engine.py`

### Testing Requirements
- Create test file: `/tests/test_copy_to_editor.py`
- Use existing test patterns from `/tests/test_*.py` files
- Focus on edge cases and null handling
- Mock Streamlit session state for unit testing

### Technical Constraints
- Streamlit version compatibility (check requirements.txt)
- Session state persistence across reruns
- Thread safety for concurrent users

### Integration Verification Points (from Epic)
- IV1: Existing SQL execution flow remains unchanged
- IV2: Session state management doesn't break other features
- IV3: Performance impact is negligible (<100ms added latency)

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `/tests/test_copy_to_editor.py`
- Testing framework: pytest (based on existing test files)
- Mock Streamlit components using unittest.mock
- Cover all acceptance criteria with specific test cases
- Ensure integration tests verify session state persistence

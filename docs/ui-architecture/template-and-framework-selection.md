# Template and Framework Selection

## Framework Decision

**Selected Framework**: Streamlit (Existing Implementation)

This project is built on **Streamlit**, a Python-based framework that creates web applications for data science and analytics. Since this is a brownfield optimization project, we are working within the existing Streamlit architecture rather than migrating to a different frontend framework.

## Streamlit Characteristics

Streamlit differs from traditional frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) in several key ways:

1. **Python-Native**: All UI logic is written in Python, not JavaScript
2. **Server-Side Rendering**: The application runs entirely on the server with automatic state synchronization
3. **Component-Based**: Uses Python functions and decorators to create UI components
4. **Reactive Programming**: Automatic re-execution based on user interactions
5. **Built-in Components**: Provides pre-built widgets for common data visualization needs

## Existing Project Analysis

Based on the codebase review:
- **Main Application File**: `startup.py` (entry point)
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Test files in `/tests` directory
- **Dependencies**: Managed through Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
- **UI Pattern**: Chat-based interface with multiple tabs (Analytics, Visualizations, Data Explorer)

## Framework Constraints

Working with Streamlit imposes these architectural considerations:

1. **No JavaScript Framework**: We cannot use React, Vue, or Angular components directly
2. **Limited Client-Side Logic**: All logic must be implemented in Python on the server
3. **Session State Management**: Uses Streamlit's session_state for maintaining user data
4. **CSS Customization**: Limited to Streamlit's theming and custom CSS injection
5. **Component Library**: Must use Streamlit-compatible components or create custom ones

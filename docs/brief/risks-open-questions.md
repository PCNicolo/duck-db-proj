# Risks & Open Questions

## Key Risks
- **LLM Accuracy:** Natural language translation may not be accurate enough for complex queries
- **Performance Limitations:** Local hardware may struggle with very large datasets despite DuckDB optimization
- **Market Education:** Users may not understand or trust local-first approach
- **Competition:** Major vendors could release similar local-first solutions
- **Technical Complexity:** Integrating DuckDB, LLM, and UI smoothly may prove challenging

## Open Questions
- What is the optimal LLM model size for accuracy vs. performance?
- How do we handle queries that would benefit from cloud computing resources?
- Should we support real-time data streams in addition to static files?
- What level of SQL knowledge should we assume in our UI design?
- How do we monetize effectively while maintaining privacy-first positioning?

## Areas Needing Further Research
- Competitive analysis of emerging local-first analytics tools
- User research on natural language query patterns and expectations
- Technical feasibility of different LLM integration approaches
- Performance benchmarking across various hardware configurations
- Legal review of data privacy claims and compliance requirements
- Market sizing for privacy-conscious analytics segment
